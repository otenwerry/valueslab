This right is fundamental to any society claiming to respect individual freedoms and privacy.\n\n2. **Healthcare Access**: Safe medical procedures, including abortion, are part of comprehensive reproductive healthcare. In regions where abortion is illegal, women often resort to unsafe methods to terminate unwanted pregnancies, leading to health complications and, tragically, death.\n\n3. **Economic Empowerment**: Women\u2019s ability to control their reproductive futures is linked to their economic well-being.
