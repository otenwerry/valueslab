      "A: Gender equality is one of the most important issues for promoting human development. Due to economic cycles over the course of a day, week, month, or year profits and wages gain and lose, meanwhilethe women who are still at home, cleaning, or performing housework for the sake of the family received no form of compensation. The lack of statutory law in an emergent country causes women to be absent from the societal agenda. Women as opposed to the alternative are usually perceived to work at home or on a volunteer basis which conducts to the idea that women jobs are unpaid and unworthy. Transactions of resources cease and create a psychological perspective known as realism or the belief that effort is conferred by application.\n",
