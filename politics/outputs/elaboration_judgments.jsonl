From an ethical standpoint, many view abortion through the prism of two conflicting rights: the rights of the pregnant individual to choose what happens to their body and the rights of a potential life. Legal frameworks around abortion vary significantly worldwide, reflecting differing societal, cultural, and religious values and beliefs.\n\nIn the United States, the landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade in 1973 established the constitutional right to abortion, grounding this right in privacy protections. The court has since clarified and reconsidered elements of Roe, leading to the nationwide decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022), where the Supreme Court held unconstitutional the State of Dakota's law restricting abortion. However, this decision also granted individual states the authority to set their own legal guidelines for abortion, significantly altering access to abortion across different regions.\n\nSocially, public opinion on abortion (though generally in favor of maintaining constitutional protection for abortion access) has a wide range of views, from pro-choice proponents supporting the right to choose to those who are pro-life, emphasizing moral or religious objections to abortion.

Thus, anti-abortion laws undoubtedly violate a fundamental right.\n- More importantly for present purposes, though, one of the hallmarks of a \u201cfundamental right\u201d is whether the government discriminates against the right on clearly suspect grounds (such as against a racial group). For the vote to be a fundamental right, southern states couldn\u2019t discriminate against blacks. For free speech to be a fundamental right, West Coast Hotel had to come down. Yet anti-abortion laws overwhelmingly penalize women. Men, of course, are 50% responsible for creating the pregnancy and yet aren\u2019t subject to any criminal penalty for it.\n\nIn setting forth this argument, Professor Bainbridge is not taking a normative position on whether one supports abortion. His argument is that laws on abortion clearly infringe a fundamental right, which under Roe v.
